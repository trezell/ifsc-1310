        My name is Tasha and I am a 34 year college student. 
        I am a high school dropout turned college graduate. 
        In 2017, when I started my career as a student, 
        I looked for a goal that would stretch me. 
        You only have a glorious rebound like this once, 
        so I felt like I needed to reach for the stars. 
        I decided to become a nurse. However, after learning that 
        I had a passion for science, and after encouragement from 
        my professors, I decided to do the unthinkable. I decided to 
        pursue medicine.
    </p> <br>

    <p>    
        I remember how amazed and proud I was of 
        myself when I was standing in the gross anatomy lab at my 
        local teaching hospital. I was eager to learn as much as I could
        about the human body. And then COVID hit. My class was shut down. 
        I took the opportunity to really contemplate what it meant to be a 
        physician and what would be required of me. I knew this would be the 
        hardest thing I had ever done. But it wasn't until I saw the devastation 
        of the healthcare system that I made the decision to step away from 
        medicine before I was locked into insurmountable student loan debt.
        Stepping away from medicine was the hardest thing I had ever done.
    </p><br>
    <p> 
        I graduated with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Biology in May 2020. I had to 
        regroup quickly and found a job in an amazing lab, processing kidney
        specimens for the rarest kidney pathologies faced today. It was an 
        amazing opportunity! But I hated it. It lacked creativity and freedom and 
        I sunk low into a deep depression. Then I learned about this fancy things 
        called SQL and how interesting it was to make technology work for us 
        humans. Now, I am going for my second B.S. degree, this time in 
        computer science. Suffice it to say, I am a glutton for punishment. 
        I think that's why I love triathlon so much! IT. IS. HARD.

    <h2>Where I Began</h2>
    <p>
        As with any story, it began when I was a child. 
        I spent most of my free time on my bicycle. 
        I spent hours riding through the countryside, 
        qtearing up miles of backroads, cutting through streams, 
        valleys, and fishtailing around corners. Although the tan 
        I had from back then has now faded, the strength and 
        yearning for freedom has never waned. There was something 
        special about leaving a trail of dust behind me. The 
        adrenaline was all consuming. I was a little addict!
    </p><br>
    <p>
        By the time I was a young adult, that once monumental joy 
        for riding, went dormant. Slowly, I stopped moving, withdrew 
        into depression and morphed into a morbidly obese adult. 
        In 2017, I went on a strict diet and lost a whopping eighty-five 
        pounds. Although I seemed happy, I was incredibly weak and 
        unhealthy. I wasn't eating enough of the right things and 
        consequently, I lost a tremendous amount of muscle. My doctor 
        recommended I begin weightlifting. After a few months of training, 
        I began to experience the "flame of athleticism". I felt powerful and 
        capable for the first time in my life. Eventually the strictness 
        faded, giving way to old habits which allowed the weight to quickly 
        return with a vengeance. As so many women can attest to, the 
        weight came back and then some. That's when I realized I wasn't 
        approaching this in a way that set me up for success. Following 
        strict diets and waiting for my perfect body to arrive before I 
        allowed myself to enjoy movement, would only ever lead to failure. 
        This shift in thinking allowed me to see myself in a brand-new light. 
        I would no longer be willing to wait for fitness to arrive before enjoying 
        movement. I had to learn how to enjoy movement in the body I already had.

    <h2>Where I Went</h2>
    <p>
        By May 2022, I was pushing three hundred pounds and movement was 
        painful. I decided enough was enough and I took my first walk in ages. 
        I stumbled upon a gloriously secluded trail at a local park. Being short 
        circuit of .75 miles, few people used the trail. One morning, after a 
        fresh rain, I went for my walk. Halfway through my trail I ran into a 
        massive swarm of gnats. I couldn't breathe without inhaling them. In 
        a fit of rage, I took off running. If I was running, I wasn't being bothered 
        by those pests. So, I stayed running. Shortly into my run, I felt something 
        indescribable. My heart rate was even, my pace was steady, and my 
        breathing wasn't labored. I was in this zone and all I could hear was my 
        breathing and my sneakers hitting the asphalt. I felt like I could fly. A 
        quick google search revealed that I experienced runner's high, and I was 
        bought and sold, fish, line, and sinker. 
         
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Suddenly I was excited to wake in the morning and go for a run. One day, 
        I woke up to rain. I couldn't imagine not going for a run. I shortly found 
        myself running a loop through my house shouting "No excuses!" I ran 1 mile 
        in my house that day. Although that worked for a while, I knew I needed a 
        plan for bad weather. On May 15, 2022, I purchased my first treadmill. The 
        following day I went to see my rheumatologist who gave me some of the most 
        devastating news I had ever received. It wasn't the worst thing to ever happen 
        to me, it was all about the timing of things. I was informed that I had early onset 
        arthritis in my knees and ankles. He advised me under no circumstances should 
        I use a treadmill. Further, he said he couldn't even recommend walking as a form 
        of exercise for me. Several tears later, I realized this was not the end for me. I had 
        found something I just couldn't live without, and having just found it, I could not 
        give it up without a fight.

    <h2>Where I Am</h2>
    <p>
        After my diagnosis, I dove deep into my fitness. I was not 
        going to let that devastating news define me. I began to run, 
        bike, and weight train nearly every day 4 to 5 times per week. 
        I soon realized that I was way overtraining. I had to learn 
        the difference between showing myself grace (to prevent 
        overtraining) and making excuses. Happily, I can report that 
        I have lost over twenty pounds and have begun the lifelong 
        journey of learning the limits of my body. And I learned about 
        a sport I have become incredibly drawn to, like a moth to a flame. 
        A sport with a community of people who see me not as a fat woman, 
        but as an athlete.
