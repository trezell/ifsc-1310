      <li><h3>What if I don't like one of the sports?</h3></li>
      <p>That's quite okay. Many triathletes have a sport that they like the least.</p>
      <li><h3>What does your typical week of training look like?</h3></li>

    <li><h3>How did you get started?</h3></li>
    <p>It has taken me several months just to acclimate to movement. Now that I am nearly ready, the season has closed.
      Because I have been training relentlessly, I know by the time next season opens, I will be ready for a sprint! 
      My goal is to be able to reach the required distance for each sport and then incorporate what is called brick training. 
      I am taking Meredith Atwood to heart when she said <q>The... journey is about making bold moves and strong 
      decisions, but that does not necessarily mean rushing into goals either. </q>
      The following is a table demonstrating
      my typical training week.</p>
    <li><h3>Where do I start?</h3></li>
    <p>It's good to get a baseline for each sport. You can print off a sheet to write down
      all of your sports stats. Start on your bike and ride for as long as you can, being
      sure to pace yourself. Record your time and distance. Do the same for all three
      sports. This will give you a general idea of where you are. Then make every effort
      to get better with each practice session.  
    </p>
