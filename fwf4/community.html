    <h2>About the Community</h2>
    <p>The triathlon community is full of people from all walks of life. There are all
        types of people at all types of fitness levels. Because the sport of triathlon
        is so trying and takes a great deal of preparation, there is so much mutual
        respect between triathletes. 
    </p>
    <p>I strongly encourage joining a local triathlon group. The benefits vary by group but 
      often include savings at local sporting stores, special (sometimes free) training
      sessions, and practice course information. My local triathlon group gives out 
      discount cards to their members, as well as free merchandise and entrance to a 
      private lake for open water swimming practice. I've also received a free gait analysis
      and plan to take part in next season's stroke analysis. Additionally, members meet 
      frequently to run, ride, and swim together. This really comes in handy when you struggle
      to get those last few miles! 
    </p>
    <p>Having a community is so very helpful. Training can get a little boring after
      a while and having people around you to make your training entertaining can make
      a huge difference. In fact, several triathlon veterans wonder if they could have
      made it as far as they have if they hadn't had the support they did. Community
      is so very important and I encourage every interested athlete to investigate to find
      their own community. 
    </p>
    <p>But what if you don't have a group near you? Can you still develop a community 
      to help you achieve your goals? Absolutely! In fact, the vast majority of my support
      comes from the internet. There are numerous facebook groups and subreddit groups that 
      are super helpful and inviting and unlocks the chances of finding other fat triathletes.
      Yes. We are out there! You are not the only one!!
