                <h3><em>Where it Began</em></h3>
                <p>
                   It all really began when I was a child. I spent
                    I spent most of my free-time on my bicycle. 
                 I spent hours riding through the countryside, tearing up miles of backroads, cutting through streams, valleys, and curves. 
                 On my bike, I was safe and all was right in the world. Although the tan I had from back then has faded, the strength and yearning for freedom never has. 
                 By the time I became a young adult, that once monumental joy for riding, went dorment. 
                Slowly, I stopped moving, withdrew into depression and morphed into a morbidly obese adult.  
                </p>
                <h3><em>Where I Went</em></h3>
                <p>
                    In 2017 I went on a strict diet and lost 85 pounds. Although I seemed happy, I was incredibly weak and unhealthy. 
                    I wasn't eating enough of the right things and consequently I lost a tremendous amount of muscle. My doctor recommended I begin weight lifting. 
                    After a few months of training I began to experience the flame of athleticism. I felt powerful and capable. 
                    Eventually the strictness faded, giving way to old habits that allowed the weight to quickly return with a vegence. 
                    As so many women can attest to, the weight came back and then some. That's when I realized something had to change. 
                    Following strict diets and waiting for my perfect body was only ever going to lead to failure. I began to see my body in a whole new light. 
                    I was no longer willing to wait for fitness to arrive before enjoying movement. I needed to learn how to enjoy movement in the body I already had.

                </p>
                <p>
                    By May 2022, I was pushing 300 pounds and movement was painful. I decided enough was enough and I took my first walk in ages. 
                    I had found a gloriously secluded trail at a local park. Being .75 mi, no one took the trail. One morning, after a fresh rain, I went for my walk. 
                    Halfway through my trail I ran into a massive swarm of gnats. I couldn't breathe without inhaling them. In a fit of rage, I took off running. 
                    As long as I was running I wasn't being bothered so I tried to keep running. Shortly into my run I felt this surge, this tremendous high. 
                    It took me 34 years to realize I was a lucky few who actually experienced runners high. I was sold in that moment. 
                    Then the rain set it. One rainy day, I found myself running a loop through my house shouting "No excuses!" I ran 1 mile in my house that day. 
                    I knew I needed something new. On May 15, 2022, I bought my first treadmill. 
                    On May 16th, my doctor told me I had early onset arthritis in my knees and ankles and stressed that I shouldn't use a treadmill or even walk as a form of exercise. 
                    A few tears later, I realized this was not the end for me. I had found something I just couldn't live without. 
                </p>
                <h3><em>Where I am</em></h3>
                <p>
                    After my diagnosis, I dove full tilt into my fitness. I was not going to let that devastating news define me. I began to run, bike, and weight train nearly every day.
                    I was so geared towards changing my life I started over training. I was weight training, running, and biking in one day and doing it 4 to 5 times per week.
                    I have had to learn the difference between showing myself grace (to prevent overtraining) and making excuses. Happily, I can report that I have lost almost 20 pounds
                    and have learned the limits of my body. And I learned about a sport I have become incredibly drawn into. A sport with a community of people who see me not as
                    a fat woman, but as an athelete.
                </p>
                <h3><em>Who I am</em></h3>
                <p>
                    My name is Tasha and I am a 34 year college student. I am a high school drop out turned college graduate.
                    In 2017, when I started my career as a student, I looked for a goal that would stretch me.
                    You only have a glorious rebound like this once, so I felt like I needed to reach for the stars.
                    I decided to become a nurse. However, after learning that I had a passion for science, and after 
                    encouragement from my professors, I decided to do the unthinkable. I decided to pursue medicine. 
                    I remember how amazed and proud I was of myself when I was standing in the gross anatmoy lab at my local
                    teach hospital. I was eager to learn as much as I could about the human body. And then COVID hit. 
                    My class was shut down. My MCAT test was canceled. I took the opportunity to really contemplate
                    what it meant to be a physician and what would be required of me. I knew this would be the hardest thing 
                    I had ever done. But it wasn't until I saw the devestation of the healthcare system did I make the 
                    decision to step away from medicine before I was locked into an insurmountable amount of student loan debt.
                    I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Biology in May 2020. I had to regroup quickly and found a job
                    in an amazing lab, processing kidney specimens for the rarest kidney pathologies faced today. It was an
                    amazing opportunity! But, I hated it. It lacked creativity and freedom and I sunk low into a deep depression.
                    Then I learned about this fancy things called SQL and how interesting it was to make technology work for us humans.
                    Now, I am going for my second B.S. degree, this time in computer science. Suffice it to say, I am a glutton
                    for punishment. I think that's why I love triathlon so much! IT. IS. HARD.

                <p>This community is so vast and so great that I don't even need to know the individuals to feel acceptance. 
                    One of my favorite books is written by a member of the triathlon community. Her book is one of the reasons
                    I felt this connection to community. She is just like me. But she says it so much better.

                <p>
                    The sport that I fell in love with is called triathlon.
                    Some may have heard of the infamous Ironman Race.
                    Now, I may never do a full-on Ironman, however,
                    I can assure you I am well on my way to a sprint.
                    So what exactly is a triathlon? 
                    It is a racing event in which a person partakes in 
                    3 major sporting events in one sitting. The events vary by distance.
                    The typical race and the order of the activities are as follows:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Swimming</li>
                        <li>Biking</li>
                        <li>Running</li>
                    </ol>
            </p>
            <h4>There are 4 main types of triathlon</h4>

            <div class="post-content">
            <p>It has taken me several months just to acclimate to movement. Now that I am nearly ready, the season has closed.
                Because I have been training relentlessly, I know by the time next season opens, I will be ready for a sprint! 
                My goal is to be able to reach the required distance for each sport and then incorporate what is called brick training. 
                I am taking Meredith Atwood to heart when she said <q>The... journey is about making bold moves and strong 
                decisions, but that does not necessarily mean rushing into goals either. </q>

                my typical training week.</p>
