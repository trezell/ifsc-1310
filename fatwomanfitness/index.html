    <h2>Where it Began</h2>
    <p>
        It all really began when I was a child. I spent most of my free-time on my bicycle.
        I spent hours riding through the countryside, tearing up miles of backroads, cutting through streams, valleys, and curves.
        On my bike, I was safe and all was right in the world. 
        Although the tan I had from back then has faded, the strength and yearning for freedom never has.
        By the time I was a young adult
