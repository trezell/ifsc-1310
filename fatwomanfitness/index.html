    <h2>Where it Began</h2>
    <p>
        It all really began when I was a child. I spent most of my free-time on my bicycle.
        I spent hours riding through the countryside, tearing up miles of backroads, cutting through streams, valleys, and curves.
        On my bike, I was safe and all was right in the world. 
        Although the tan I had from back then has faded, the strength and yearning for freedom never has.
        By the time I became a young adult, that once monumental joy for riding, went dorment. Slowly, I stopped moving, withdrew into depression and morphed into a 
        morbidly obese adult.

    <h2>Where I Went</h2>
    <p>
        In 2017 I went on a strict diet and lost 85 pounds. Although I seemed happy, I was incredibly weak and unhealthy. 
        I wasn't eating enough of the right things and consequently I lost a tremendous amount of muscle. My doctor recommended I begin weight lifting.
        After a few months of training I began to experience the flame of athleticism. I felt powerful and capable.
        Eventually the strictness faded, giving way to old habits that allowed the weight to quickly return with a vegence.
        As so many women can attest to, the weight came back and then some. That's when I realized something had to change. 
        Following strict diets and waiting for my perfect body was only ever going to lead to failure. I began to see my body in a whole new light.
        I was no longer willing to wait for fitness to arrive before enjoying movement. I needed to learn how to enjoy movement in the body I already had.

    <p>
        By May 2022, I was pushing 300 pounds and movement was painful. I decided enough was enough and I took my first walk in ages. 
        I had found a gloriously secluded trail at a local park. Being .75 mi, no one took the trail. One morning, after a fresh rain, I went for my walk.
        Halfway through my trail I ran into a massive swarm of gnats. I couldn't breathe without inhaling them. In a fit of rage, I took off running.
        As long as I was running I wasn't being bothered so I tried to keep running. Shortly into my run I felt this surge, this tremendous high. 
        It took me 34 years to realize I was a lucky few who actually experienced runners high. I was sold in that moment. Then the rain set it.
        One rainy day, I found myself running a loop through my house shouting "No excuses!" I ran 1 mile in my house that day. I knew I needed something new. 
        On May 15, 2022, I bought my first treadmill. On May 16th, my doctor told me I had early onset arthritis in my knees and ankles and stressed that I shouldn't 
       use a treadmill or even walk as a form of exercise. A few tears later, I realized this was not the end for me. I had found something I just couldn't live without.

    <h2>Where I am</h2>
    <p>
        After my diagnosis, I dove full tilt into my fitness. I found a sport that had all the activities I loved. I found the sport of triathlon. 
        A triathlon consists of three sports:
        <ul>
            <li>Swimming</li>
            <li>Biking</li>
            <li>Running</li>
        </ul>
