        <h3>Where it Began</h3>
        <p>
            It all really began when I was a child. I spent most of my free-time on my bicycle. 
            I spent hours riding through the countryside, tearing up miles of backroads, cutting through streams, valleys, and curves. 
            On my bike, I was safe and all was right in the world. Although the tan I had from back then has faded, the strength and yearning for freedom never has. 
            By the time I became a young adult, that once monumental joy for riding, went dorment. 
            Slowly, I stopped moving, withdrew into depression and morphed into a morbidly obese adult.    
        </p>
        <h3>Where I Went</h3>
        <p>
            In 2017 I went on a strict diet and lost 85 pounds. Although I seemed happy, I was incredibly weak and unhealthy. 
            I wasn't eating enough of the right things and consequently I lost a tremendous amount of muscle. My doctor recommended I begin weight lifting. 
            After a few months of training I began to experience the flame of athleticism. I felt powerful and capable. 
            Eventually the strictness faded, giving way to old habits that allowed the weight to quickly return with a vegence. 
            As so many women can attest to, the weight came back and then some. That's when I realized something had to change. 
            Following strict diets and waiting for my perfect body was only ever going to lead to failure. I began to see my body in a whole new light. 
            I was no longer willing to wait for fitness to arrive before enjoying movement. I needed to learn how to enjoy movement in the body I already had.
        </p>
        <p>
            By May 2022, I was pushing 300 pounds and movement was painful. I decided enough was enough and I took my first walk in ages. 
            I had found a gloriously secluded trail at a local park. Being .75 mi, no one took the trail. One morning, after a fresh rain, I went for my walk. 
            Halfway through my trail I ran into a massive swarm of gnats. I couldn't breathe without inhaling them. In a fit of rage, I took off running. 
            As long as I was running I wasn't being bothered so I tried to keep running. Shortly into my run I felt this surge, this tremendous high. 
            It took me 34 years to realize I was a lucky few who actually experienced runners high. I was sold in that moment. 
            Then the rain set it. One rainy day, I found myself running a loop through my house shouting "No excuses!" I ran 1 mile in my house that day. 
            I knew I needed something new. On May 15, 2022, I bought my first treadmill. 
            On May 16th, my doctor told me I had early onset arthritis in my knees and ankles and stressed that I shouldn't use a treadmill or even walk as a form of exercise. 
            A few tears later, I realized this was not the end for me. I had found something I just couldn't live without. 
        </p>
        <h3>Where I am</h3>
        <p>
            After my diagnosis, I dove full tilt into my fitness. I was not going to let that devastating news define me. I began to run, bike, and weight train nearly every day.
            I was so geared towards changing my life I started over training. I was weight training, running, and biking in one day and doing it 4 to 5 times per week.
            I have had to learn the difference between showing myself grace (to prevent overtraining) and making excuses. Happily, I can report that I have lost almost 20 pounds
            and have learned the limits of my body. And I learned about a sport I have become incredibly drawn into. A sport with a community of people who see me not as
            a fat woman, but as an athelete.

    <h2>About the Sport</h2>
    <p>
        The sport that I fell in love with is called triathlon. Some may have heard of the infamous Ironman. Now, I am far from being an ironman but I can asure you I 
        am well on my way! So what exactly is a triathlon? It is a racing event in which a person partakes in 3 major sports in one sitting. The typical race and it's
        order is as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Swimming</li>
        <li>Biking</li>
        <li>Running</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <h4>There are 4 main types of triathlons, which vary only by distances.</h4>
        <ol>
