    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive enhancement essentially means that webpages are displayed in layers. Content is first, then CSS, followed by JavaScript. 
      Progressive enhancement is taking content and displaying it depending on the limitations the viewer may have. For some people, 
      all they can handle is the content. Whether they are on an older computer or have settings that don’t allow for a more immersive browsing 
      experience, having the option to view the content alone allows them to engage despite their limitations. Sometimes a viewer may be able to 
      handle some but not all display types. For example, some may not have the support needed to display JavaScript but could handle most CSS. 
      Therefore, the separation is important as is the content first perspective. This perspective provides compatibility and stability for all 
      users. Without it we are left to the limitations of Graceful Degradation, which refers to a break in functionality that brings the entire 
      system down.<br> <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/">Outside Link</a> </p>
      <h2>Fat Woman Fitness Reflection</h2>
      <p> 
        I believe I did well in this class. I learned a great deal and was able to grasp the concepts presented.
        I think I did great at building a website from the ground up as I did not use the html provided for the project.
        If I had to start over I would have paid a little closer attention to JavaScript and I would have found more time
        to enhance the website more. One of the recommended things for my webpage was that the pictures were too big. 
        I elected not to change this because I wanted to immulate my favorite website <a href="https://www.liv-cycling.com/us">Liv</a>
        which uses large and vibrant photos that look more like a website of art than that of a bicycle retailer.
